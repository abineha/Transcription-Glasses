# Transcription-Glasses
AR glasses that allow deaf people to ‘see’ conversations by turning audio into subtitles.

ABSTRACT:
People with hearing loss and deaf people communicate in many ways-sign language, lip reading, hearing aids, etc. However, methods such as hearing aids and cochlear implants can be very expensive to acquire. Meanwhile, signing and lip reading require eyes on the speaker. An AR glass with Speech-to-text conversion is the answer to provide a comfortable wearable assistive technology device for deaf, hard of hearing, elderly, and other people. It allows them to improve their comprehension of spoken communication using captions.
The device uses AI technology to transcribe speech in real-time, ideally for people who are hard of hearing or deaf. To start building the AR glasses, we reflect an image that brings new information to one’s field of view without blocking their real-world view.
